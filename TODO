Implement Volume & Snapshot

Extract likely common bits:
  - pulling crap out of the hashes
  - load / reload / find
  - saving to simple db
  - think about a AwsResource or some such bs as a superclass

Reconstruct the DSL:
  - extract DSL class again
  - create the concept of a launchable
  - have ApplicationStack known only about launchable
  - handle attaching of volumes to snapshot be a launchable

Create the capistrano integration
  - add the concept of a role to awsymandias
  - create the stack keyword
  
  
Think about naming for stacks:
  - data center?
  - topology?
